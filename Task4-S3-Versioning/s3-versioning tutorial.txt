How to Enable Versioning on an S3 Bucket
🔹 Step 1: Go to Your Bucket
Open AWS Console → Go to S3

Click on your bucket -jhansi-newbucket

🔹 Step 2: Enable Versioning
Go to the Properties tab

Scroll down to Bucket Versioning

Click Edit

Select Enable

Click Save changes

🧪 How It Works 
1️⃣ Upload a file (e.g., report.txt)
→ This is Version 1

2️⃣ Upload the same file again with changes
→ Now it becomes Version 2 of report.txt

3️⃣ Go to the object → Click Versions tab
→ You'll see both versions, with different Version IDs

4️⃣ Delete the object
→ It adds a delete marker — the object disappears, but you can restore it by deleting the marker
